   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:
   ```
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file to add your actual API keys.

## Required API Keys

- **DEEPSEEK_API_KEY** (required): For the DeepSeek AI model

## Usage

Run the application from the command line:
```bash
python main.py
```

By default, the application will analyze Microsoft (MSFT). To analyze a different stock, modify the ticker in the `main()` function.

After analysis completes, you will have a CSV file in the output directory that looks like:

```

## Extending the Project

You can easily extend this project by:

- Adding more data sources (e.g., options data, insider trading)
- Creating a command-line interface to specify tickers at runtime
- Comparing multiple stocks simultaneously
- Storing analysis results in a database for historical comparison
- Building a web interface to visualize the results
